        <strong>Describe your skill level in Programming Languages</strong>
    </h2>
        I would call myslef an expierenced Coder, I have a high skill level in logical coding. I know C, C++, Java, &amp Python. I have had a lot of expience with python, This expience was derived from a lot of application based learning. When it comes to Mark-up Languages, I have always wanted to learn proper front=end development, but never recieved the proper guidence. Part of the reason I have taken this course on Web Technologies is mainly to learn proper front-end development. This will help me out in the future as Web Designing and Web Development is what majority of the jobs require.
